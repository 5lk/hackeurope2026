# Handoff: impl-1

**Summary**: I will implement the core game components: Snake, Food, and GameBoard. The Snake class will handle its own body, direction, and movement logic. The Food class will manage its position and respawning. The GameBoard class will define the play area and manage game state updates, including collision detection.

## Files Changed

- output\src\snake_game\food.py

## Notes
