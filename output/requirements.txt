  "summary": "I will implement a basic Flappy Bird game structure using Pygame. The core logic will focus on handling player input to make the bird 'flap'. The project will include a `Game` class to manage the main loop and game states, a `PlayingState` to handle the gameplay logic, and a `Bird` component representing the player. The `PlayingState`'s event handling will specifically listen for the spacebar or up-arrow key presses, triggering the `flap` method on the `Bird` object, which applies an upward velocity. The project will be runnable, with a `main.py` entry point and a `requirements.txt` file.",
