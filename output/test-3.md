# Handoff: test-3

**Summary**: ```python
# test_gameplay.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
import sys
import os

# Add the directory containing main.py to the path
# This is a common pattern when testing modules not installed as packages
# Assuming main.py is in the parent directory relative to the test file
sys.path.insert(0, os.

## Files Changed
- output\tests\test_test_3.py

## Notes
- QA worker completed (summary only).
- Wrote test stub: output\tests\test_test_3.py
