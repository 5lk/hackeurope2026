# Handoff: impl-4

**Summary**: I will implement the main game loop in `main.py`. This will involve initializing the game state, renderer, and input handler. The loop will process user input, update the game state according to the game logic, and render the current state to the screen, bringing all the separate components together into a playable game.

## Files Changed
- output\main.py

## Notes
- SWE worker wrote project files (two-phase).
