# Handoff: impl-3

**Summary**: I will implement the `PygameView` in `src/view.py` to handle all rendering tasks, including initializing the Pygame window, drawing the snake, food, and score. In `src/controller.py`, I will implement the `PygameController` to process keyboard inputs for snake movement and quitting the game, mapping Pygame events to game actions.

## Files Changed
- output\src\controller.py

## Notes
- SWE worker wrote project files (two-phase).
