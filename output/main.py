  "summary": "I will implement the main game loop in `main.py`. This script will initialize the game components, including the game state, renderer, and input handler. The main loop will process user input, update the game state based on game logic and elapsed time, and render the current state to the screen. Since no architect contracts were provided for the components, I am assuming the existence and basic interfaces of `src.game_state.GameState`, `src.game_logic.update_game_state`, `src.renderer.Renderer`, and `src.input_handler.handle_input`. Clarification on these interfaces would be beneficial.",
