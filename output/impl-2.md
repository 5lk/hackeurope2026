# Handoff: impl-2

**Summary**: I will implement the core game logic in `game.py` within a `Game` class. This class will manage the game state (playing, game over), handle snake movement, detect collisions with walls and the snake's own body, and manage food consumption and scoring. In `main.py`, I will create the main game loop, which will initialize the game, process user input for snake direction, and call the appropriate methods in the `Game` class to update and draw the game state.

## Files Changed
- output\main.py

## Notes
- SWE worker wrote project files (two-phase).
